# React

4/7/24 - Report 10

Worked 5 hours.

## This Week 

Did very little this week. I was learning React just for giggles and I spent a
few hours trying to adapt the UI to use React and Vite. I gave up on this again
because I would have had to rewrite all my existing web components as react 
components.

I then got somewhat closer to u-substitution. It threw me for a few loops.
I've decided to implement a Substitution expression type, and I'm most of the 
way through implementing this.

I also threw together a commandline binary target to test the backend. The WASM
error messages for any panics in Rust are completely unusable so this will
make debugging easier.

## Next Week

Continue to work on u-substitution.
