# ihateintegrals

This crate provides types to represent mathematical expressions and simplify
them automatically showing the steps used to derive the answer. This includes
solving integrals. This crate is used as a backend for my cas website at
[ihateintegrals.com](ihateintegrals.com).

See crate [documentation](https://docs.rs/ihateintegrals/latest/ihateintegrals/)
for examples and use.
